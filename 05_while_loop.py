#Let us say i want to print until the number 10
#we can do it like this:

print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
print(4)
print(5)
print(6)
print(7)
print(8)
print(9)
print(10)

#     OR
myvalue = 1
while myvalue < 11:
    print(myvalue)
    myvalue = myvalue + 1

# Make sure you have decreased the value  or else you might 
# run into an infinite loop
